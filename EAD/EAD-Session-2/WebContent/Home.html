			HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language[1] for creating 
			webpages. Webpages are usually viewed in a web browser. They can include 
			writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. HTML is used to mark
			and describe each of these kinds of content so the web browser can show 
			them correctly.
			</p>
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<p>
			HTML can also be used to add meta information to a webpage. Meta 
			information is information about the web page. For example, the 
			name of the person who made it. Meta information is not usually 
			shown by web browsers.

			Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript can be included in HTML
			code. CSS is used to change how a webpage looks. JavaScript is used
			to add features to webpages and make them more interactive.

			HTML was made by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). There are many 
			versions of HTML. The current standard is HTML 4.01. So, it is the 
			version the W3C recommends. A newer version, called HTML5, will become 
			standard within the next few years. The W3C also develops XHTML. This 
			is another markup language which is very similar to HTML, but more strict.
			</p>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<p>
			One of the aims of HTML5 is to remove the need to use third-party software 
			like Adobe Flash, because it is often slow on mobile devices like phones 
			and can be used to infect your computer with viruses. Another aim is to 
			reduce the amount of program code (JavaScript) running in each webpage, 
			thus making the web faster.
